* CCFinder 

This is my attempt to provide life support to ccfinder. I have
collected its source code, and the great work that Nic Bettenburg did
documenting how to build it under Linux. It also fixes some
configuration problems that have arisen since ccfx was first released.

** Requirements

The easiest way is to build it under Ubuntu linux: you need the following libraries:

- libboost-all-dev 
- libpython2-all-dev  (make sure you have version 2.7, it is incompatible with version 3)
- libicu-dev 
- openjdk-7-jdk 


** Building

Now, make an offering to the make gods (good options are  Vishwakarma, Hephaestus, and Vulcan).

Run 

  export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64
  cmake CMakeLists.txt 

some warnings will appear, but hopefully it finishes to completion.

and if succesful run:

./ubuntu32/ccfx
